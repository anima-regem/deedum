# deedum

A [Project Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) browser.

Should be in app/play stores soon!

## Development

Build should just require installing [flutter](https://flutter.dev/), connecting an android phone over usb (with developer mode turned on):

```
flutter build apk --debug
flutter install
```

I haven't been able to get ios building yet because of xcode / macos version restrictions.
